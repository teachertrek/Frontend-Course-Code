JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JavaScript Objects are important for handling data in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes. JSON is a lightweight data format for transferring data, while JavaScript Objects are in-program data structures used for manipulation and logic.

1. What is JSON & why it is used ?
   
   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data format designed for data exchange. It is language-independent and follows a strict syntax for storing and transmitting data.



    JSON keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.
    It supports only limited data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.
    Used for transferring data between servers and applications.

2. Uses of JSON 
   1. Fetching data from server/Sending Data to the server
   2. Configuration files
   3. Storing data in LocalStorage / session storage
3. JSON.stringify()
4. JSON.parse()
5. Difference Between OBJ and JSON
6. Serialization & Deserialization
   1. Serialization
     Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, typically a string.

     ex - OBJ to JSON.stringify
    2. Deserialization
       Deserialization is the process of converting the serialized format back into a usable object or data structure.
     ex. JSON.stringify to OBJ
