<!-- ! #  A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to a selector, to define a style for a special state of an element. -->

<!-- Pseudo-classes Used on Links -->
<!-- ? For HTML links, it is common to use the following pseudo-classes: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- :link - Styles unvisited links -->
<!-- :visited - Styles visited links -->
<!-- :hover - Styles an link on mouse over -->
<!-- :active - Styles an activated link -->

// First Child
// last child
// nth child
// focus


<!-- Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive. -->
