# The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.


# Note: Remember that the height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins! They set the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!

# The height and width properties can have the following values:
auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height or width in px, cm, em, etc.
% - Defines the height or width in percent of the containing block
inherit - The height or width will be inherited from its parent value


# max-height & max-width
# background color
